# Cyclic-lines

>  Fun fact, cyclic-lines comes from a randomly generated name for another project, i just randomly wanted my own twitch alerts so i built this instead.

My hyper personnal twitch stream manager (Commands, Alerts, TTS and so on)

Note: It does not include any front-end, because that part I consider you can build your own, the backend is enough to connect to and receive events to any front page that hooks into OBS.

## How to use ?

Well i don't know, figure out yourself *nerd*.
